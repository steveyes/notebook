## Relative pronouns and relative clauses

> https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/relative-pronouns-and-relative-clauses

The relative pronouns are:

| Subject | Object   | Possessive |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| who     | who/whom | whose      |
| which   | which    | whose      |
| that    | that     | -          |



### *Where* as a question word

We can use *where* to ask for information about place:

> *Where did you buy those shoes?*

> *Where will you be working next Monday?*

We can use *where* in indirect questions:

> *I asked him where I could buy an umbrella.*

> *Can you tell me where she left the keys?*



### Emphatic questions with *wherever* and *where on earth*

We can ask emphatic questions using *wherever* or *where on earth* to express shock or surprise. We stress *ever* and *earth*:

> *Wherever are you going with such a big bag?* (stronger than *Where are you going?*)

> *Where on earth have I put my wallet?* (stronger than *Where have I put my wallet?*)



### *Where* as a conjunction

We use *where* as a conjunction meaning ‘in the place that’ or ‘in situations that’. The clause with *where* is a subordinate clause and needs a main clause to complete its meaning. If the *where* clause comes before the main clause, we use a comma:

> *Where you find a lot of water, you will also find these beautiful insects.*

> *Where you have to pay a deposit, be sure to get a receipt.*
>
> 

### *Where* as a relative pronoun

We can use *where* as a relative pronoun:

> *The hotel where we spent our honeymoon has been demolished.*

> *The hall where you’re giving your talk has a really good sound system.*
>
> 



## 'to'-infinitives

### Verbs with to-infinitives

We use the *to-*infinitive after certain verbs (verbs followed by *to*-infinitive), particularly **verbs of thinking and feeling**:

|        |        |      |                 |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | --------------- |
| choose | hate   | like | prefer          |
| decide | hope   | love | remember        |
| expect | intend | mean | want            |
| forget | learn  | plan | would like/love |

> They **decided to** start a business together.
>
> **Remember to** turn the lights off.

and verbs of **saying:**

|       |         |        |          |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| agree | promise | refuse | threaten |

> We **agreed to** meet at the cinema. 
>
> **Promise to** call me every day.

Some verbs are followed by a **direct object** and then the *to-*infinitive:

|           |          |        |                 |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| advise    | intend   | remind | would like/love |
| ask       | invite   | tell   | woud prefer     |
| encourage | order    | want   |                 |
| expect    | persuade | warn   |                 |

> He encouraged **his friends** to vote for him.
>
> **Remind me** to give Julia a call.



### Infinitive of purpose

We also use the *to-*infinitive **to express purpose** (to answer *why?*):

> This pool is being re-purposed **to hold** backup flow service. 
>
> He bought some flowers **to give** to his wife.
>
> He locked the door **to keep** everyone out.

We can also express purpose with **in order to** and ***in order not to***:

> We started our journey early **in order to** avoid the traffic.They spoke quietly **in order not to** wake the children.

or ***so as to*** and ***so as not to***:

> We started our journey early **so as to** avoid the traffic.They spoke quietly **so as not to** wake the children.



### Adjectives with to-infinitives

We use the *to-*infinitive after certain adjectives:

|         |       |          |           |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | --------- |
| able    | due   | likely   | prepared  |
| unable  | eager | unlikely | willing   |
| anxious | keen  | ready    | unwilling |

> Unfortunately, I was **unable to work** for over a week.
>
> I'm really tired. I'm **ready to go** to bed.

Sometimes the *to-*infinitive **gives a reason** for the adjective:

|              |         |          |           |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| amazed       | glad    | proud    | sorry     |
| delighted    | happy   | relieved | surprised |
| disappointed | pleased | sad      | unhappy   |

> We were **happy to come** to the end of our journey.
>
> (= We were happy because we had come to the end of our journey.)
>
> John was **surprised to see** me
>
> (= John was surprised because he saw me.)

We often use *it + be* followed by an adjective to give opinions:

|           |         |            |       |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| clever    | foolish | nice       | right |
| difficult | hard    | possible   | wrong |
| easy      | kind    | impossible | silly |

> It's **easy to play** the piano, but it's very **difficult to play** well.
>
> He spoke so quickly that it was **impossible to understand** him.

We use the **preposition *for*** to show who these adjectives refer to:

|           |      |      |          |            |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| difficult | easy | hard | possible | impossible |

> It was **difficult for us to hear** what she was saying.
>
> It is **easy for you to criticise** other people.

With the other adjectives, we use **the preposition *of***:

> It's **kind of you to help.**
>
> It would be **silly of him to spend** all his money.
